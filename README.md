Data
====
Some of the data was small enough to be included in this repository.  The shapefiles for the zip codes of the United states were downloaded from Tiger (US Census Bureau): http://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2013/ZCTA5/tl_2013_us_zcta510.zip

Extract the zip to the US_ZCTA_2013 folder within the repo.
